# Tools and commands

Tool availability depends on the host mode.

## Host surface matrix

| Host / integration | Tool surface | Additional capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| `opencode` (plugin) | 19 tools in total (15 portable tools + 3 knowledge-base tools + 1 OpenCode-native tool) | Slash commands and `index_visualize` |
| MCP clients, including `codex`, `claude`, and `jcode` | 18 tools + 5 prompts (15 portable tools + 3 knowledge-base tools) | Knowledge-base management for every MCP client; no OpenCode slash commands |
| `pi` (Pi extension) | 18 tools total (15 portable tools + 3 Pi knowledge-base tools) | Bundled `codebase-search` skill with host-specific knowledge-base names |

### Portable MCP core (15 tools)

These tools are available through the MCP server and the OpenCode plugin.

- `codebase_context`
- `codebase_edit_context`
- `codebase_search`
- `codebase_peek`
- `index_codebase`
- `index_status`
- `index_health_check`
- `index_metrics`
- `index_logs`
- `find_similar`
- `implementation_lookup`
- `call_graph`
- `call_graph_path`
- `pr_impact`
- `code_communities`

The MCP server also exposes five prompts:

- `search`
- `find`
- `definition`
- `index`
- `status`

### Knowledge-base tools

The MCP server and the OpenCode plugin expose the same three knowledge-base tools. The index is the union of the project code and the configured knowledge-base folders.

- `add_knowledge_base`
- `list_knowledge_bases`
- `remove_knowledge_base`

Notes for MCP clients:

- `add_knowledge_base` writes the path to the **project-local** host config of the MCP server (for example `<repo>/.claude/codebase-index.json` for the `claude` host, or `<repo>/.codebase-index/config.json` for `codex`, `jcode`, and `pi`), and refreshes the index. It is not a user-global change.
- The MCP server runs at a fixed project root (`process.cwd()` or `--project`) for its lifetime. Knowledge-base tools operate on that root and the server host config; they are not per-call worktree-aware. For worktree-local knowledge-base management, use OpenCode or Pi.
- Different MCP hosts pointed at the same repository keep separate knowledge-base lists in separate host config files.
- `list_knowledge_bases` shows the union of project-local and user-global knowledge bases. `remove_knowledge_base` edits only the project-local config, so a knowledge base inherited from a user-global config is not removable by this tool.
- Git blame metadata is collected only for files in the project git repository. Knowledge-base files outside the repository remain searchable by content but have no blame, so `blameAuthor`, `blameSha`, and `blameSince` filters match only in-repo files.

### OpenCode-only tools and commands

OpenCode adds one extra tool beyond the shared MCP and OpenCode set:

- `index_visualize`

`index_visualize` generates an interactive HTML view of recent code movement and the call graph.

OpenCode also exposes slash commands (see [OpenCode slash commands](#opencode-slash-commands)).

### Pi naming notes

Pi does not expose the shared knowledge-base names. It registers equivalent tools with host-specific names:

- `knowledge_base_list`
- `knowledge_base_add`
- `knowledge_base_remove`

Pi exposes all 15 portable tools, including `call_graph` and `call_graph_path`, plus its three host-specific knowledge-base aliases.

## Recommended selection order

1. `index_status` when index readiness is unknown.
2. `codebase_context` for a repository question that may require discovery, a definition, or a dependency path.
3. `codebase_peek` for direct low-token location discovery.
4. `implementation_lookup` for a known symbol or definition question.
5. `codebase_search` when full matching source content is required.
6. `grep` for exact identifiers or exhaustive text matches.
7. `call_graph` or `call_graph_path` for graph-specific questions.

## Core retrieval tools

### `codebase_context`

Preferred entry point for general repository questions. It returns a bounded, deduplicated, file-diverse evidence pack. It can also route explicit symbol definitions or `from`/`to` dependency-path requests.

Important options include result limits, file and directory filters, path disambiguation, and a `tokenBudget` from 128 to 4000 tokens.

Set `diagnostic: true` when troubleshooting a surprising result. MCP returns the normal text response unchanged and provides bounded routing, retrieval, and evidence-pack traces as structured content. OpenCode and Pi render the same diagnostics alongside the normal response. Leave it unset during normal use.

### `codebase_peek`

Returns likely locations and metadata without full source bodies. Use it when you want to choose files before reading them.

### `codebase_search`

Returns full semantic search results, optionally with context lines and filters. Use it after discovery when you need implementation text.

### `implementation_lookup`

Finds authoritative definition locations and prefers implementation files over tests, documentation, examples, and fixtures.

### `find_similar`

Finds code analogous to a supplied snippet. Useful for duplicate detection, pattern discovery, and refactoring preparation.

## Index lifecycle tools

### `index_status`

Reports readiness, chunk counts, compatibility, current provider/model, and index health information.

### `index_codebase`

Creates or updates the index. Incremental indexing is the default. Use `force: true` only for a required full rebuild. `estimateOnly` reports estimated embedding work without indexing.

### `index_health_check`

Removes stale references and reports orphan or artifact health.

### `index_metrics`

Returns process-lifetime operational metrics and enabled privacy-safe effectiveness aggregates.

### `index_logs`

Returns recent in-memory debug logs when debug logging is enabled.

## Call graph and impact tools

### `call_graph`

Finds direct callers or callees for a function or method. File-path disambiguation is available when names are duplicated.

### `call_graph_path`

Finds the shortest known call path between two named symbols.

### `code_communities`

Discover call-graph communities and hub symbols, and summarize coupling between communities.

Options:

- `branch`: optional branch name to analyze.
- `minSize` (default 1): minimum number of symbols in a community.
- `limit` (default 20): maximum number of communities and hub nodes returned.
- `hubThreshold` (default 5): minimum distinct cross-community neighbors for a symbol to appear as a hub node.
- `minCoupling` (default 1): minimum distinct cross-community connection count required for a coupling entry.
- `couplingLimit` (default 20): maximum number of couplings included in results.

Output includes community summaries, hub node rows, and `Community couplings` entries with representative symbol-to-symbol relationships.

### `pr_impact`

Analyzes changed files, affected symbols, transitive dependencies, graph communities, hub nodes, conflicts, and merge risk for a branch or pull request.

## OpenCode-native tools

OpenCode registers the 15 portable tools, the three shared knowledge-base tools, and one OpenCode-only tool:

- `index_visualize`

`index_visualize` generates an interactive HTML view of recent code movement and the call graph.

Pi also provides native integration for knowledge bases using `knowledge_base_list`, `knowledge_base_add`, and `knowledge_base_remove` tool names.

Tool descriptions and MCP initialization instructions include routing guidance, but the client decides whether and when to invoke tools.

## OpenCode slash commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/status` | Check index readiness and provider metadata |
| `/index` | Incrementally index the repository |
| `/reindex` | Force a complete rebuild |
| `/search` | Search by meaning and return source results |
| `/peek` | Find likely locations with minimal content |
| `/find` | Combine semantic discovery with precise follow-up |
| `/definition` | Find a symbol's authoritative definition |
| `/call-graph` | Query direct callers or callees |
| `/pr-impact` | Analyze branch or pull-request impact |
| `/visualize` | Generate the interactive index visualization |

The command definitions live in [`commands/`](../commands/).

## Filters

Search tools support combinations of:

- file extension
- directory
- chunk type
- git blame author
- git blame SHA
- git blame date
- result limit
- source context lines

Branch scoping is enabled by default for repository searches.

## Exact search still matters

Semantic retrieval is not a replacement for exact text search. Prefer `grep` when:

- you know the exact identifier
- you need every occurrence
- you are searching generated data or unusual syntax
- the file is not indexed

Use semantic tools when you know the behavior or intent but not the name.

See [Installation](installation.md) for host setup and [Configuration](configuration.md) for indexing and search behavior.
